\paragraph{What is a supercookie?}
A supercookie is like other cookies, but it is associated to first-level domain names, e.g. .com. It is stored in the cache of a browser, the browser deletion procedure does not affect supercookies. Supercookies can store more information, can be permanent and they are also saved when using "private browsing mode".

\paragraph{What is browser fingerprinting?}
Browser fingerprinting is a technique that can uniquely identify a browser over a set of rather stable metrics. For example, user agent, headers in HTTP request and super cookie settings. Fingerprint precision increases with the uniqueness of the user's configuration. The more you "personalise" your browser, the least common its configuration will be.

\paragraph{What is TOR?}
Tor is a virtual distributed network that allows the user to achieve high privacy levels thanks to Onion routing. It allows the user to connect to a certain service without intermediary infrastructural nodes knowing. Even the final destination never knows who really send the request. Tor creates a virtual network with known nodes.  

However, the exit node sees the original traffic, which means that if your username and password is in the clear, we start all over again.
